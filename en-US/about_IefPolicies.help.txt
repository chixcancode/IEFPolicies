SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions to create and manage deployment of Azure b2C IEF Policies.
 
LONG DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions to intelligently create, upload and download xml IEF policies used for
    custom journeys in Azure AD B2C. The 'New-IefPolicies' will download a set of one of the official 
    starter packs from Github.
    The upload function will automatically replace
    occurrences of 'yourtenantname', 'ProxyIdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId' and 
    'IdentityExperienceFrameworkAppId' (the latter appear in the extension xml provided by the Starter Policies) 
    with the appropriate values from the tenant you are logged into. It will also replace any
    occurrences of '{<string>}' with values of proprties with name <string> in a json
    file optionally provided to the command. You can also have the upload inject a string into the name of every policy
    to allow for multiple policy sets in your tenant.
    The upload will determine sequence for uploading the files based on their <BasePolicy> specification.
    The upload will store the source of files updated as per above in a separate folder. a subsequent call to
    the upload function will only upload files with timestamps later than those in the separate folder.
    These functions can be used either via an interactive user signin or using application credentials. For the latter
    use an application needs to be regsitered in your tenant with the following application Graph permissions:
    1. Application.Read.All 
2. Domain.Read.All
3. Organization.Read.All
4. Policy.ReadWrite.TrustFramework

    This module exports the following functions:
        Connect-IefPolicies
        Import-IEFPolicies
        Export-IEFPolicies
        Add-IefPoliciesSample
